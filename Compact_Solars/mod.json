    "description": "Compact Solar Arrays, an Industrial Craft 2 mod that adds in three new Solar Panel type blocks: Solar Arrays.\nSolar Arrays condense 8 (Low Voltage), 64 (Medium Voltage) or 512 (High Voltage) Industrial Craft 2 solar panels into a single block.\nThis significantly reduces the CPU impact of large amounts of Solar Energy gathering so is a common server enhancement.\nNew in 4.0: Solar Hats- charge armor at the same rate as their block counterparts would",
